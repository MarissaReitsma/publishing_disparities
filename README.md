# Exploratory Work on Publishing Disparities in "Top" Medical Journals

I extracted PMIDs for articles published in NEJM, Nature, JAMA, Health Affairs, Annals of Internal Medicine, JGIM, JAMA Network Open, and American Journal of Epidemiology from 2019-2023 from [pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

I ran these PMIDs through [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov/analysis) to extract citation counts for each article.

I predicted author gender based on their first name. Although this is imperfect, it is a common approach in large-scale scientometrics and suitable for exploratory analyses.

I then analyzed publication and citation rates by gender of first and senior authors across journals.

Replication code is posted, contact mreitsma@stanford.edu with questions.
